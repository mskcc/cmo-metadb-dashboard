## Run

Make sure you have installed the node version and yarn version specified in
[package.json](https://github.com/mskcc/smile-dashboard/blob/master/package.json).

> **Tip:** We recommend that you use [nvm: Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [yvm: Yarn Version Manager](https://yvm.js.org/docs/overview) to switch between versions more easily.

```
rm -rf node_modules
```

Make a copy of [./env/application.properties.EXAMPLE](./env/application.properties.EXAMPLE) and save as `./env/application.properties`.

Fill out the properties in `./env/application.properties`.

To run launch the GraphQL client:

```
node index.js
```

The GraphQL client will be available at `https://localhost:4000` and the Apollo GraphQL can connect at `https://localhost:4000/graphql`
